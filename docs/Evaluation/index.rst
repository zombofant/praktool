Evaluating the data
===================

In **praktool**, you evaluate your data using
:doc:`Tables <Table>` and :doc:`Columns <Column>`.

It tries its best to assist you with the boring work of statistics,
including but not limited to calculating statistical errors and
correctly propagating errors through complex derivation expressions.

After giving a short example on how to evaluate data with praktool,
we will guide you through the classes and their interfaces which will
assist you with your more advanced work.
